# ddoc

Of course this site is made with ddoc.

See the source at [https://github.com/Canop/ddoc/tree/main/website](https://github.com/Canop/ddoc/tree/main/website)

bacon's website looks a lot like the one of ddoc, with different colors but the same layout.

# broot

![broot](img/examples/broot.png)

broot's website is similar to ddoc's too, but shows how a bigger documentation fits ddoc without problem.

broot uses additional scripts (in [/src/js](https://github.com/Canop/broot/blob/main/website/src/js/)) and stylesheets (in [/src/css](https://github.com/Canop/broot/blob/main/website/src/css/)) to highlight code and to group block codes and wrap them with tabs.
