# ddoc

Of course this site is made with ddoc.

# bacon

bacon's website looks a lot like the one of ddoc, except colors don't try to be neutral.

broot's website is similar to ddoc's too, but shows how a bigger documentation fits ddoc without problem.

To support tabs wrapping configuration snippets, a small script is injected.
You can consult it in `/website/src/js`.
